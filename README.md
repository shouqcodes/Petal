Petal App is a plant rental software that helps people rent their favorite plants. This project is dedicated to IT320 course, KSU 2023.

<h3> The Problem:</h3>
Many people who desire to have indoor plants in their homes or offices face challenges in caring for them due to lack of time, resources, or knowledge; leading to frequent plant replacement and waste. Many people also struggle with selecting the right type of plant for their environment and the level of care required to maintain them. This results in a need for a plant rental service that offers high-quality plants and assumes responsibility for their maintenance, providing a viable solution for plant enthusiasts who aspire to create lush and eco-friendly environments.

<h3> The Solution:</h3>
Our solution to this issue involves introducing Petal app that offers plant rental services. This app provides users with a broad range of plant options that match their preferences and living conditions and gives the flexibility to rent plants for a duration suited to their needs. Furthermore, these features offer users an easy way to enjoy the benefits of having plants without the long-term responsibility that comes with plant ownership. Petal App is a software that has been specifically designed to operate on Android mobile devices. 

<h3> Product Vision:</h3>
<i> For people who own many plants and who need plants temporarily, the Petal App is an Android mobile application that offers an alternative to the typical physical ways of renting plants. Unlike the current renting apps, our product provides a locally dedicated renting app in Saudi Arabia. </i>
